                            <p>A 60 minute class of poses and slow movement that focuses on asana (proper alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and guided meditation to foster your mind and body connection. This class is intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the practice of yoga.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class=onethird>

                            <p>A 60 minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized movement — you will inhale and exhale as you flow energetically through yoga poses. While intended for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are welcome to join in this class.</p>

                    <div class=onethird>
                    <h3>Restorative Yoga</h3>
                        <p>A 90 minute class that features very slow movement and long poses. Restorative yoga is useful in relieving stress and fostering a sense of well-being. This calming, restorative experience is suitable for students of any level of experience.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
                    <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
